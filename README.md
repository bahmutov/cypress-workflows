# cypress-workflows
> Reusable Cypress workflows for GitHub Actions

Call these workflows from your GitHub Action workflows, a single line (with parameters) let's you run N parallel test jobs without any configuration.

## Example

Check out the source code, install and cache dependencies, and run all Cypress specs using the following workflow, store the `cypress/screenshots`, `cypress/videos`, and `cypress/results` artifacts.

In your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` use the following:

```yml
name: ci
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    # use the reusable workflow to check out the code, install dependencies
    # and run the Cypress tests
    # https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows
    uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/standard.yml@v1
```

### store-artifacts

default `true`. Stores the test run artifacts.

### start

A common scenario is to start the application and wait for it to respond. You can pass parameters to the workflow with the start command and the address to wait for.

```yml
name: ci
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    # use the reusable workflow to check out the code, install dependencies
    # and run the Cypress tests
    # https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows
    uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/standard.yml@v1
    with:
      start: npm start
      wait-on: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'
```

## Record the run

To record the test run on the Cypress Dashboard, pass the options to the workflow and the record key as a secret

```yml
name: ci
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    # use the reusable workflow to check out the code, install dependencies
    # and run the Cypress tests
    # https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows
    uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/standard.yml@v1
    with:
      record: true
    secrets:
      recordKey: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

## Split example

Let's split all specs across 3 machines using [cypress-split](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split) plugin. Configure the plugin using its documentation, then use this workflow:

```yml
name: ci
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    # https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows
    uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/split.yml@v1
    with:
      n: 3
```

Sometimes you might want to run a single command before all split jobs start. You can use `before-run` parameter. See [rn-examples](https://github.com/bahmutov/rn-examples)

```yml
name: ci
on: push
jobs:
  component-tests:
    # https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows
    uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/split.yml@v1
    with:
      # print the test names
      before-run: 'npm run test-names --silent'
      component: true
      n: 2
```

If you click on the "prepare" job, the `before-run` step prints the test names

### marge

Combines all separate Mochawesome JSON reports into a single HTML report including screenshots and videos.

```yml
# https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows
uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/split.yml@v1
with:
  n: 3
  marge: true
```

Assumes the project has installed `mochawesome`, `mochawesome-merge`, and `mochawesome-report-generator` dependencies.

```js cypress.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'
export default defineConfig({
  // https://github.com/adamgruber/mochawesome
  reporter: 'mochawesome',
  reporterOptions: {
    useInlineDiffs: true,
    embeddedScreenshots: true,
    reportDir: 'cypress/results',
    reportFilename: '[name].html',
    overwrite: true,
    html: true,
    json: true,
  }
})
```

See the example in [bahmutov/cy-report-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-report-example) and read the blog post [The Battle of Cypress Mochawesome Reporters](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/the-awesome-battle/).

## Parallel example

Let's split all tests across 3 machines using [Cypress Parallelization](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) paid feature.

```yml
name: ci
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    # https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows
    uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/parallel.yml@v1
    with:
      n: 3
    secrets:
      recordKey: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

Result:

## Workflows

- [standard.yml](./.github/workflows/standard.yml) checks out code, installs dependencies, and runs tests on a single machine
- [split.yml](./.github/workflows/split.yml) checks out the coe, installs dependencies, splits specs per machine using [cypress-split](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-split) plugin.
- [parallel.yml](./.github/workflows/parallel.yml) lets you specify the number if test machines to use. Splits specs using Cypress Dashboard

The workflows allow passing pretty much all [Cypress GH Action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action) parameters, see the individual workflow YML file.

## Versions

Advice: use an explicit [release tag](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workflows/releases) when using a workflow like `parallel.yml@v1.0.1`. You might also use the latest release from the major branch `v1` like `parallel.yml@v1`. Not recommended: using the latest commit on the branch `parallel.yml@main` or using a specific commit `parallel.yml@2a9d460`.

## Debugging

### debug-inputs

You can print the workflow inputs using the parameter `debug-inputs`, for example

```yml
uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/standard.yml@v1
with:
  debug-inputs: true
```

Should print something like

```
Debug inputs üêû
{
  "record": false,
  "config": false,
  "config-file": "",
  "envs": "grepTags=@nightly",
  ...
  "quiet": false,
  "debug-inputs": true
}
```

### debug variable

You can set the environment variable `DEBUG` to enable verbose output from the [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug#readme) module, often used by Cypress and its plugins.

```yml
uses: bahmutov/cypress-workflows/.github/workflows/standard.yml@v1
with:
  debug: cy-grep
```

Should print something like:

```
cy-grep cy-grep plugin version 1.3.1 +0ms
cy-grep Cypress config env object: { grepFilterSpecs: true, grepOmitFiltered: true, CACHE_FOLDER: '/home/runner/.cache/Cypress' } +1ms
cy-grep specPattern cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} +2ms
cy-grep excludeSpecPattern *.hot-update.js +0ms
```
